# Things to Do 


## Refactor
Refactor code into show types to make easier to extend
DO THIS FIRST BEFORE ANYTHING


## Analyser
Add analyser, do each field
DO THIS NEXT TO GET LISTS OF VARIANTS


## Fixes
You'll see incorrect stuff come up
e.g. EAC being assigned to quality title instead of audio codec 
Use analysis results to come up with custom fixes

## Improve regex 
Find out if can add to regex to specifically not assign EAC to other groups

Define list of audio codecs

If in list , add audio codec prefix like edition uses

Match based on prefix not value
Guaranteed match!



## Readmes
Improve MEDIA repo READMEs, like audio ones


## Future 
Generate folder with easily readable markdown
